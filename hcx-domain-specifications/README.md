# Domain Specifications

This section focuses on **domain** **specifications** needed to realize the health claims data exchange. As detailed in the [key specification](../open-specifications/key-specifications.md) section, the most significant aspect of domain specification would be agreement on formats for data exchange (data models and any domain specific languages to assist standardisation) and terminologies (taxonomies) being used in those data models. &#x20;

Details of Open Protocol and TechOps policies are covered in the [previous section](../hcx-technical-specifications/).
