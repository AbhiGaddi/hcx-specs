# Contributing to the specifications

As mentioned in the governance section, hcx-specifications are fundamental to the success of the envisioned claims network. Specifications need to create consensus amongst a broad base of health system stakeholders to ensure that they can act as this common foundation. Current specifications are a result of collaborative effort from many committed volunteers.&#x20;

We look forward to further strengthening the collaboration with border participation. Sections below provide the key resources and mechanisms to contribute to the specifications.

### Contributing to the specs&#x20;

#### Responding to consultation questions&#x20;

Consultation questions for any of the releases can be responded to using the respective discussions in the forum.&#x20;

#### Enhancement requests/ideas/suggestions/questions&#x20;

Please use the github discussion forum to ask questions, make suggestions, and raise enhancement requests. You can also participate in the existing discussion by appropriately commenting on the discussions of your interest.&#x20;

#### Raising issues&#x20;

Issues can be raised to bring attention to any shortcoming in the specifications ( e.g. API specifications, Domain Data specifications - eObjects, Documents, Value Sets, Implementation Guide etc.) using one of the following mechanisms:&#x20;

1. A confirmed issue can be raised as a github issue against the repo [here](https://github.com/Swasth-Digital-Health-Foundation/hcx-specs/issues).&#x20;
2. If unsure about the issue, it can be raised as a [discussion](https://github.com/Swasth-Digital-Health-Foundation/hcx-specs/discussions) with the community and can be converted to an issue on confirmation.

We aim to make hcx-specifications one of the best open community projects with your help. In order to achieve this, we expect the participants to follow [GitHub's community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines) and adhere to the [GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct) while participating in the forum.

If for some reason, one cannot answer the consultation questions or raise issues using github, you can also send them via email to [hcx@swasthapp.org](mailto:hcx@swasthapp.org). However, to get the best assistance from the community, get timely responses and benefit everyone from the observations, we encourage everyone to use the github forum.&#x20;
