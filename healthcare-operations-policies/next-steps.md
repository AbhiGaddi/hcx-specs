# Next steps

An HCX network would be an important infrastructure service for the healthcare industry. Its continued, predictable operation and evolution with the needs of the ecosystem would be essential for the smooth functioning of the participating health care system. Inability to do so can cause damage to the participating systems and the public they serve.

Therefore, guiding policies for the network continues to be a focus area for the HCX Policy Guidelines working group, and more robust guidelines are expected in upcoming versions of the protocol.&#x20;
