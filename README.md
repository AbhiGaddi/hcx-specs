# Summary

Inspired by the recommendations of the Joint Working Group of NHA and IRDAI (2019), Health Claims Data Exchange (HCX) is an ambitious open source project that aims to define interoperable protocol specifications to enable a multi-party exchange of health claims information.

The HCXs can be thought of as routing switches or email gateways that facilitate communication with the desired level of consistency, security, privacy, and durability. However, unlike the internet or email, this protocol is defined for a specialized use case of exchanging health claims-related information between relevant actors - payors, providers, beneficiaries, regulators, observers, etc. Current Status Following table provides a summary of the existing specification versions and links to the respective documentation.&#x20;

| 0.6 (Baseline)            | September 08, 2021 | Base version of specifications. It was built by 60+ volunteers from across the healthcare ecosystem (including Insurers, Hospitals, TPAs, Insurance Technology players and Think tanks) as a part of a transparent, collaborative and open effort during July 2020-September 2021 and launched for public consultation on September 08, 2021. You can find the launch details and list of volunteers [here](https://hcx.swasth.app).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
