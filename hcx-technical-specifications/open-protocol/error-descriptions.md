# Error Descriptions

HCX gateway and the participant systems (mainly, the recipient systems) need to validate for certain conditions and raise errors with appropriate error codes and details. Broadly, there are following two categories of errors:

1. Error scenarios that are validated by the HCX gateway and send the error details to the sender either synchronously in the HTTP response to the API call or in the asynchronous callback API.
2. Error scenarios that are validated by the recipient systems and send the error details in the asynchronous call back API or in the synchronous response to the HCX gateway (which in turn sends it to the sender).

#### HCX Gateway Error Scenarios
